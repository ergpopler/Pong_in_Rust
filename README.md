# Pong_in_Rust

MADE PONG IN RUST, FIRST TIME I MADE A GAME, MY BAD caps lock was on.

just do `cargo run` and it will run, and if you want the executable, do `cargo build` and go in the target folder and look for the Pong or Pong.exe file...

this thing is absolute garbage at the moment, gonna learn to do AI stuff, might take a day, might take a month, who knows, but I will probably make the player 2 an AI, and also give it a start screen, because it needs that. anyways its pretty cool, you can adjust the constants and play around with them to change the games difficulty, so on and so forth.

feel free to do the start screen for me, would be appreciated!
